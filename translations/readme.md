# InnerSource Patterns Translations

Welcome to the **InnerSource Commons Africa** translations folder! This space is reserved for making InnerSource patterns and materials accessible in African languages. Our goal is to help developers and organizations across Africa understand and apply InnerSource practices, regardless of language barriers.

## Purpose

We are in the early stages of building a repository of translations for InnerSource patterns. These patterns, originally available in English, describe best practices for adopting and implementing InnerSource within organizations. By translating them into various African languages, we hope to foster greater inclusivity and collaboration.

## How You Can Help

We're looking for contributors to help translate InnerSource patterns into African languages. If you're fluent in a local language and want to contribute, here’s how you can get started:

### Steps for Contributing

1. **Create a Language Folder**: If your language doesn’t have a folder yet, create a new one in this `translations` directory. Name the folder after the language, using lowercase letters (e.g., `swahili`, `zulu`, `hausa`).
   
2. **Select a Pattern**: You can find the list of InnerSource patterns to translate [here](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns).

3. **File Naming**: When translating a pattern, create a markdown file (`.md`) with the English title of the pattern as the file name (e.g., `trusted-committer.md`).

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've translated a pattern, submit your contribution as a pull request to the repository. 

### Format

Please keep the structure of the original English pattern intact, with a clear title and proper formatting. Additionally, include the following at the top of each translation:
Original Pattern: [Pattern Title] Language: [Your Language] Translator: [Your Name]
